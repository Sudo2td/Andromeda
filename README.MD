# Intro
Androemda is a Software that has collections of basic software in one. This means that some of this software can really be usefull.

# Requirements
YOU DO NEED TO HAVE GIT AND PYTHON BOTH INSTALLED

# Downloading The Software
If you already have a copy of the repo then just open "update.py" this file will
simply update the software to the latest version if you dont have the software yet
or you don't want to use this method then this method also works.

```
# This download's the repository in the directory
git clone https://github.com/Sudo2td/Andromeda

# This will Update the Software
git pull
```
This method is actually the same as opening the file cause all the file is doing
is simply typing that command in the terminal. I did that for people that aren't tech
savy or don't know how to use the terminal etc
